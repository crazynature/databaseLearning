//If I run the test manually, all of them can pass.
//so you may need to comment some tests and run them one by one

// first plz run initTest
// second run findTest
//third run deleteTest

//They will pass, if you run them all together, the initAnswer test will fail. I tried many ways, only this function will fail and cannot fix it
